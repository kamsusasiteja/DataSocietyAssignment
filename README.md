#### Write a weather-forecasting application that takes geographic US latitude/longitude values as input and presents the weather from a point in time at the given location(s). Use a language and presentation method of your choice.

#### This application should:
- Accept geographic US latitude/longitude values as input
- For example: 39.7456, -97.0892

#### Retrieve weather data using this free weather service: API Web Service (https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1641768438693965&usg=AOvVaw3OWCV8Z2DjkIpuF6eXz_L2)

### Present the “temperature” value for “Wednesday Night” at the input location

- Your chosen tools will dictate your presentation method, but the key to this requirement is that the end-user receives the resulting forecast data. 
- This could be done via a dynamic web page, command-line output, etc.
- Along with the source code, include a README.md file in Markdown format which documents your solution and how to use it. Deliver the application via shared git repository (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket).
